## Why use WPDirectDB
Wordpress is the most popular CMS currently, however it's also a bloated solution. There is one thing where Wordpress shines, and that is it's user friendly admin interface. For managing posts and media files Wordpress is a robust and easy to use solution. WPDirectDB is meant to help with building a decoupled Wordpress solution, leaving the flexibility build a custom frontend. When you need to connect to the Wordpress database including the whole Wordpress backend code is a big performance hit. WPDirectDB is an easy solution to get posts directly from the database, without the need to include Wordpress in you frontend code.
